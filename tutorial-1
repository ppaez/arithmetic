ending the operation with an equals sign, for example:

Single spaces may be used between the quantities and the
operators for clarity.  Two or more spaces, or a colon
delimit an operation, like here: 100 + 1 =

You may use 'x' as the multiplication symbol in most

Operations can be...   (2+7)x5 =   anywhere!
