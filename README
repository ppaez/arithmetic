arithmetic is a Python module that allows mixing arithmetic
operations and text.  It resembles the calculator program bc.

A sample Tk-based editor that uses the module is provided as
a starting point.

Tutorial documents are included, they will quickly show
all the features of arithmetic.


Using the tutorials

Open files tutorial-1 and tutorial-2 with Libreta,
the editor application included with the module.

There is no need to install the module, Libreta runs
as is from the source directory:

-  In GNU/Linux:  open a terminal, cd to the source 
   directory and type the following commands:

   ./libreta.py tutorial-1
   ./libreta.py tutorial-2

-  In Windows: explore the source directory and drag
   the tutorial file over the libreta.py icon.

in Windows.
