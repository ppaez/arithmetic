You can define recurrence relations:

g = g + 1      the initial value:  g = 1

The result for g changes every time you obtain it. 

Add a formula that depends in g, actually another
recurrence relation and its initial value: 

factorial = factorial x g     factorial = 1

g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial = 
g =         factorial =
