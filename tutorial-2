You may do standard arithmetic operations in a document,
for example, assign values to two variables:

     height = 20       width = 30

And define a formula:   area = height x width

To obtain the result of the formula, press <F5>:

     area = 

<F5> also updates the result of area below,
after one of the values is modified: height = 25

     area = 

Other examples of formulas, try modifying the values of f
and c will change after updating with <F5>:

c = (f - 32) x 5 / 9

f = 212     c =
f = 100     c =
f = 70      c =
f = 32      c =
f = -40     c =
