Assign values to variables:

a = 12   b = 5

Use the variables in expressions:

a + b =        a x b =       a / b =      a - b =      a^b =   a**b =

Define a formula:   area = height x width

Assign values and request the result:

     height = 200       width = 300

     area = 

Calculate the results for different points:

width = 100   area = 
width = 400   area = 
width = 500   area =
